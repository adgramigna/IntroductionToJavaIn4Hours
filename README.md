# IntroductionToJavaIn4Hours

This repo contains the paper I wrote in my final year as a Master's student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In this paper I describe in detail my process of creating 12, roughly 20 minute video lectures on basic Java concepts such as Objects, Arrays, recursion, and looping. Students found the videos very helpful: the average helpfulness rating was a 4.72/5, with a minimum of 4, and median of 5. Currently I do not wish to make these videos public but if you would like to view them please email me at adgramigna1 at gmail dot com.
